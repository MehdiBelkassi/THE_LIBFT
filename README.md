# The_libft

The Libft project was a cornerstone in my journey to mastering C programming, teaching me how to recreate standard library functions and build my own reusable library from scratch. I developed a deep understanding of fundamental concepts like memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and string handling while ensuring efficiency and robustness in my implementations. This project also sharpened my debugging skills as I worked through edge cases and unexpected behaviors. By adhering to the strict Norminette coding standards, I learned to write clean, structured, and maintainable code. Beyond coding, Libft emphasized the importance of building a solid foundation for future projects, as this library serves as a reliable toolkit for solving diverse programming challenges.
